The idea of this app is from my everyday life. My wife and I are using Google Keep to share shopping list with each other. For my wife cannot drive, I usually drive to grocery stores like Costco, H Mart, or Trader Joe's. Google Keep is good enough to share shopping list. This is becuase before using Google Keep, we used instant messenger. However, it was really difficult to track the shopping list.

What if there's a simpler app to share shopping list, keep shopping history, and find stores more easily, I would definitely use the app. Now, I can make an app that can be used to share shopping list between family members.
